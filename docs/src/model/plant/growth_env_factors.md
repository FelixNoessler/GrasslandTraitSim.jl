# Community growth adjustment by environmental and seasonal factors
The listed functions limit the growth potential of all 
plant species without any species-specific reduction:
- â˜€ the photosynthetically active radiation [`radiation_reduction!`](@ref)
- ðŸŒ¡ the air temperature [`temperature_reduction!`](@ref)
- ðŸ“ˆ a seasonal effect, that is modelled by the accumulated degree days [`seasonal_reduction!`](@ref)
