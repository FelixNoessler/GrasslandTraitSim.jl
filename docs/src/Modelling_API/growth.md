## Adjustment by environmental factors

The listed functions limit the growth potential of all 
plant species without any species-specific reduction:
- â˜€ the photosynthetically active radiation [`radiation_reduction`](@ref)
- ðŸŒ¡ the air temperature [`temperature_reduction`](@ref)
- ðŸ“ˆ a seasonal effect, that is modelled by the accumulated degree days [`seasonal_reduction`](@ref)
- an effect that a smaller plant community can build up less biomass [`community_height_reduction`](@ref)

## Species-specific adjustment

```@raw html
<div class="mermaid">

    F[â‡… light competition] --> C[[species-specific adjustment]]
    G[below ground competition] --> H
    G --> I
    H[â†“ water stress] -->  C

### [Influence of plant height](@id plant_height)

```@raw html
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    K(trait: height) -->|taller plants get\nmore light| F
    F[â‡… light competition] --> C[[species-specific adjustment]]
</div>
```

Taller plants get more light and can therefore growth more than smaller plants. 
This is modelled by the influence of the potential height in relation to the community 
weighted mean potential height.

The potential height refers to the height that the plant would reach 
if it would not be limited by other factors.

### Water stress

</div>
```

The species differ in the response to water stress by the different [specific leaf areas](@ref "Specific leaf area linked to water stress") and [root surface areas per above ground biomass](@ref "Root surface area / aboveground biomass linked to water stress"). The values of both response curves are multiplied to get factor that reduces the plant available water.

It is implemented in [`water_reduction!`](@ref).

### Nutrient stress

```@raw html
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    S[â†“ nutrient stress] 
    N[nutrient index]
    R[trait: root surface area /\n aboveground biomass]
    A[trait: arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation]
    B[belowground competition]
    L[plant available nutrients]

    N --> L
    B --> L
    L --> S
    R --> S
    A --> S;
</div>
```

The species differ in the response to nutrient availability by different proportion of mycorrhizal colonisations and root surface per above ground biomass. The maximum of both response curves is used for the nutrient reduction function. It is assumed that the plants needs either many fine roots per above ground biomass or have a strong symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi. 

It is implemented in [`nutrient_reduction!`](@ref).
